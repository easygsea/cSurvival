# Adjust censoring time
Censoring allows analysis with a specified time interval. You may choose a censoring time in days, months (30.4375 days), or years (365.25 days). For a selected clinical endpoint (e.g. overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS)), if the time-to-event is larger than the defined time, we set censoring status to 0 and time to the defined time; if the time-to-event is smaller than or equal to the defined time, we set censoring status to 1 and time stays unchanged. By default, cases are censored at 10 years.

# Single or interaction
Under **No. of analysis:**, enter or click the upper arrow button to **2** to analyze interactions between biomarkers. Choose **1** to analyze a single biomarker.

<hr>
# Clinical endpoint (TCGA)
If TCGA, select the clinical endpoint of interest. Recommendations are provided according to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6066282/" target="_blank">TCGA pan-cancer clinical study (Liu et al., Cell, 2018)</a>. You may also click on the lightblue book button for the full published recommendation table.

# Cell lines & gene/drug (DepMap)
Using DepMap data, cSurvival can assess how a biomarker or combinations of biomarkers affect(s) the knockout (CRISPR) / knockdown (RNAi) effect of a gene, or the sensitivity to a drug compound. First, select the type of DepMap data to analyze:

<br>
Next, select the cancer type(s) to study. You may type in keywords to search your cancer type(s) of interest.

<img src="help_images/08_dp1.png" alt="" width="42%"/>

<br>
Optionally, filter the cell lines by subtypes. By default, all subtypes of the selected cancer type(s) are selected.

<br>
Optionally, manually select specific cell lines. By default, all cell lines of the selected subtype(s) are selected.

<br>
Then, type to search, and select your gene (or drug) of interest.

# Select biomarker(s)
cSurvival supports survival analysis with a wide range of biomarkers including gene or GS expression, somatic mutation, microRNA expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression. In addition, two biomarkers can be selected at a time for interaction analysis.

## Single biomarker
Make sure **No. of analysis** is **1**. You will see a light grey panel

## Two biomarkers
Make sure **No. of analysis** is increased to **2**.
