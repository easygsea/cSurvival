# Adjust censoring time
Censoring allows analysis with a specified time interval. You may choose a censoring time in days, months (30.4375 days), or years (365.25 days). For a selected clinical endpoint (e.g. overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS)), if the time-to-event is larger than the defined time, we set censoring status to 0 and time to the defined time; if the time-to-event is smaller than or equal to the defined time, we set censoring status to 1 and time stays unchanged. By default, cases are censored at 10 years.
