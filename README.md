# cSurvival: a framework with an integrated survival database to study gene, locus, pathway, and drug dependencies and interactions in cancers

This repository contains essential scripts for:

* cSurvival's algorithms, pipelines, and visualizations (built on R and R Shiny)
* Data extraction and processing steps to establish cSurvival's database (shell and R scripts)

## Quick start

cSurvival cannot start without its underlying database. Download example TCGA-LUAD datasets (.zip), decompress the files, and put the entire TCGA-LUAD folder into the designated place under www/project_data
